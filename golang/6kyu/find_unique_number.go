/** SITUATION:
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

This is the first kata in series:

1. Find the unique number (this kata)
2. Find the unique string
3. Find The Unique

	for k, v := range hash {
		if v == 1 {
